Please read this tutorial in detail!

This is a text-based adventure game set in a cave system. 
The caves are all connected, and you can move between them.
In some caves, there are people, enemies and/or items. 

A dragon has been terrorising the cave system, stealing treasures and harming the inhabitants.
You are a brave adventurer exploring these caves. 
Your righteous sense of justice drives you to slay the dragon. 
Help the people and you shall be rewarded.
""",
    """
Here are a few of the commands you can use. 

Type move to move to a connected cave.
Type inventory to see your inventory.
    You may then choose to view an item's description. (Which may contain a hint!)
    Obviously, you can only give/fight with items from your inventory. 
Type ? to show the tutorial.
Type quit to quit the game. 
""",
    """
In a cave with a person:
    Type talk to talk with them.
        They may be in need of something!
    Type give to give something to them.
In a cave with an enemy:
    Type talk to talk with them.
    Type fight to fight them using an item. 
        Make sure this item is something that will work against them though!
        If it does, you'll be able to defeat them and claim some nice loot, otherwise its GAME OVER.
        Be careful about giving an item to an enemy!
In a cave with an item: 
    Type pickup to pick the item up and add it to your inventory.
""",
    """
After completing an action (e.g. talking to someone, picking up an item), press enter to continue. 
This is to avoid having excessive "Press enter to continue" statements.

Please be careful about typos, as the game is quite space-sensitive and unintelligent.
